# Euler-Euler-numerical-simulations-of-upward-turbulent-bubbly-flows-in-vertical-pipes

This is a numerical solver for Euler-Euler numerical simulations of upward turbulent bubbly flows in vertical pipes with a low Reynolds number model. The original paper that uses this solver has been submitted to the journal Advances of Mechanical Engineering. A solver is tested in OpenFOAM v1906. 

First install library myTurbulenceModels, by running ./Allwmake inside myTurbulenceModels. Then, install solver by running ./Allwmake inside file myTwoPhaseEulerFoam.

A typical test case is also given.
